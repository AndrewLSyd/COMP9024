Hamiltonian - visits every vertex exactly once. Edges, no more than once.
Eulerarian - traverses each path once

a.
	i. no, B has odd degree
	ii. yes, there are exactly two vertices of odd degree (B and D)
	iii. yes (BAGFECD)
	iv. yes, if there is a Hamiltonian cycle, truncate the last edge and you have a path

b.
	i. yes, all vertices are of even degree (enter and leave each vertex exactly once)
	ii. no, Eulerian paths and cycles are mutually exclusive
	iii. no
	iv. yes (BAGFECD)
